# About the data
To examine spending trends in college sports, The Washington Post requested financial records for 2004 and 2014 from athletic departments at all 53 public schools in the "Power Five," the five wealthiest collegiate athletic conferences. Every year, each school sends a report detailing athletic expenses and revenues to the NCAA. Through open records requests, reporters collected 2004 and 2014 reports from 48 schools. Twelve Power Five schools are private, and their financial reports are not public records. Four public schools (Louisville, North Carolina State, Oregon State and Penn State) refused to provide 2004 reports, which are not public records in those states. One public school -- Pittsburgh -- refused to provide both 2004 and 2014 reports. To determine which departments are profitable, reporters used a methodology similar -- but more favorable to athletic departments -- to how the NCAA determines which are profitable. From earnings, reporters subtracted mandatory student fees and financial support a school gives athletics, leaving behind what the NCAA refers to as "generated revenue" -- the actual money a sports department makes. From expenses, reporters subtracted money athletic departments report giving back to schools, which the NCAA counts as an expense.

Stories written from the data can be found at https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/college-athletics-spending/. All 2004 figures in stories were adjusted for inflation, but this is the unadjusted, raw data. Reporters did not pull all revenue or expense fields, so fields don't add up to total revenue or total expenses fields in the data. The data here contains the 2014 data from Louisville, North Carolina State, Oregon State and Penn State, though their data was not included in The Post's analysis for stories.

If you obtain forms from other years or other schools, feel free to share and we'll try to add as we can. If you'd like us to add additional revenue or expense fields, let us know and we'll see what we can do.
